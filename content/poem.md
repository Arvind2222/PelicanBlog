The red, blue and Green 
I know what makes it great Much more than what it takes So not in it’s haste  
Now’s the time to fake it 
else you gonna be hated  
The trepidation always gets me  
moulding always the best me  
I wanted me someone (always)  
Someone not me  
not knowing  
How awesome I could be  
Hurry or the world knows your vehemence because tutelage is what this bluegreen strives I went to the window to look for my frail  
I ran I walked but only to stall  
Giving up was my biggest mistake  
I was to be abandoned torn and thrown  
and the difference  
How could not I make  
I - the cause of all my problems  
Dawn on me It’s the vexing world  
Now how could I care for the blurry blur  
Hell to the malaise and so stupid world  
Have a sleep while still you can  
Bon Hiver in your slippery can  
Long live the winter with its dusky flakes Knows no one to what it takes
